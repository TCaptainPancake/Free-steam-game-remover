# Free steam game remover
Simple copy paste into https://store.steampowered.com/account/licenses/ via the firefox or chrome console and set th date you want to remove games from in the menu the pops up

Only issue I have with it is its speed but can't do anything to fix that

Thanks aliceenight for adding the date picker
